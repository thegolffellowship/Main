# Customer Identity System

## Source of Truth
`customers` + `customer_emails` are the **canonical source of truth** for all customer data.
- `update_customer_info()` syncs edits to email/phone/name into `customers`/`customer_emails`,
  not just into `items.*` (transaction copies).
- `get_all_customers()` reads from `customers LEFT JOIN customer_emails WHERE is_primary=1`
  and is served by `GET /api/customers`. The Customers page overlays this data after the
  items-based map is built to always show authoritative contact info.

(For the list of tables that carry a `customer_id` FK, see `docs/claude/schema.md`.)

## Customer Lookup Flow (`_lookup_customer_id` — 5-step cascade)
When a new transaction arrives, the system resolves the customer in this order:
1. **Email via `customer_emails`** — exact email match
2. **Alias email via `customer_aliases`** — alias_type='email' JOIN customers
3. **Exact first+last name** in `customers` table
4. **Alias name via `customer_aliases`** — alias_type='name' JOIN customers
5. **Fallback: `items.customer_email`** — checks existing items for pre-migration customers

`_resolve_lookup_customer_id` (the variant used by some send paths) **also** consults
`customer_aliases` (alias_type='name') when the direct first+last name match misses, so
an `item.customer` of "Stu Kirksey" can resolve to the canonical "Stuart Kirksey" record.

## Customer Resolution (`_resolve_or_create_customer`)
- Calls `_lookup_customer_id` first
- If no match, creates a new `customers` row + `customer_emails` row
- On email IntegrityError (duplicate), returns the existing owner's customer_id instead of creating an orphan

## Canonical Identity Resolvers (`resolve_player_*`)

`items.customer_email` / `customer_phone` / `first_name` / `last_name` / `chapter` /
`user_status` are historical snapshots captured per-order — they can carry typos or stale
values that the manager has corrected on the Customer Info page. Reading `items.*`
directly resurrects bugs (e.g. handicap card preview using a typo'd email from one old
order). Five resolver helpers in `database.py` look up the canonical value via
`items.customer_id` (or by name match) and fall back to `items.*` only when nothing
canonical exists:

- `resolve_player_email(item, conn=None)` — `customer_emails.is_primary`
- `resolve_player_phone(item, conn=None)` — `customers.phone`
- `resolve_player_name(item, conn=None)` — `customers.first_name + last_name`
- `resolve_player_chapter(item, conn=None)` — `customers.chapter`
- `resolve_player_status(item, conn=None)` — `customers.current_player_status` + roles

Every customer-facing send path goes through `_resolve_player_email` (which delegates to
`resolve_player_email`): `_send_rsvp_credit_alerts`, `_build_balance_due_email`, the
`/api/items/<id>/send-payment-reminder` route, and the bulk-send composer's
`resolve_email()`. Drop the `'and i.get("customer_email")'` filters on player-collection
lists and skip rows that resolve to no email at send time, so manually-added RSVPs whose
email lives only in `customer_emails` are no longer excluded from reminders.

**Connection lifetime gotcha** — `_resolve_db` opens its own connection via
`get_connection()` and closes it directly with `conn.close()` in the resolver `finally`
blocks. The earlier implementation used `_connect(db_path).__enter__()` without holding
a reference to the contextmanager, which CPython's reference counting reclaimed
immediately and closed the underlying sqlite generator's connection in its `finally`
block — every `owns=True` resolver call then hit "Cannot operate on a closed database"
on its first `.execute()` and bubbled out of `api_send_messages` as a 500. Always open
the connection directly in resolver helpers.

## Identity Self-Healing at Boot

Three idempotent migrations run in `init_db()` so the `items` snapshot stays consistent
with the canonical `customers` / `customer_emails` records:

| Migration | What it does |
|---|---|
| `capture_email_aliases_from_items` | Promotes every `items.customer_email` value differing from the linked customer's primary email into `customer_aliases` (alias_type='email'). Idempotent — case-only variants and already-aliased typos are skipped. The Customer Info card's Aliases section then shows each captured variant under the 📧 icon. |
| `_heal_items_identity_fields` (Phase 1B) | Flattens `items.customer_email` / `customer_phone` / `chapter` / `first_name` / `last_name` to match the linked `customers` / `customer_emails` record. For email differences, captures the existing `items.customer_email` value as a `customer_alias` (alias_type='email') before overwriting. Other fields overwrite silently — there's no alias slot for phone/name/chapter, and the canonical record is by definition correct. Belt-and-suspenders behind the resolver helpers. |
| `_migrate_relabel_credit_pool_items` | Backfills descriptive `item_name` on credit-pool rows: "Excess credit — `<event>`" or "Overpayment credit — `<event>`". Idempotent (skips rows whose `item_name` already starts with the new prefix). |

## Drift detection on new orders (Phase 3)

When a new GoDaddy order arrives, `save_items()` compares the order's
`customer_email` / `customer_phone` / `chapter` against the canonical record on the linked
customer (`customer_emails.is_primary`, `customers.phone`, `customers.chapter`). For each
field that differs:

- **Canonical wins.** The items row is persisted with the manager-maintained value, never
  the order's drift.
- **A `parse_warning` is raised** (`EMAIL_DRIFT` / `PHONE_DRIFT` / `CHAPTER_DRIFT`) so the
  manager sees the discrepancy in the COO action-items banner and can decide whether to
  update the customer record, capture the variant as an alias, or dismiss it as a typo.
- `parse_warnings.customer_id` (Phase 2 FK) is populated so the warning links straight
  back to the affected customer.

## Customer Merge (`merge_customers`)
- Reassigns `items.customer` string (all transactions)
- Reassigns `items.customer_id` from source to target
- Moves `customer_emails` from source to target
- Creates name alias for old name
- Deletes orphaned source `customers` row

## Automatic Merge Repair (Boot-Time)

When a customer's profile is accidentally absorbed into another customer's record
during a bad merge, the system auto-detects and repairs it on the next boot via
`_repair_*_attribution()` functions in `email_parser/database.py`. These are called
from `init_db()` inside individual try/except blocks so one failing repair doesn't
block the others.

**Known repairs (both fully idempotent):**
- `_repair_massey_attribution()` — William Massey absorbed into Colby Johnson
- `_repair_chalfant_attribution()` — Tanner Chalfant absorbed into Bryan McCrary

**How to add a new repair:** See `docs/claude/customer-merge-repair.md` for the full
playbook — diagnosis steps, function skeleton, and 7 critical gotchas (wrong column
names, SQLite NULL comparison behaviour, identity-heal overwriting `customer_email`
before the repair runs, commit placement, etc.).

## Vendor Customers

Vendors (suppliers, payment processors, etc.) are stored in the `customers` table with
a `vendor` role in `customer_roles`.

**Key columns:**
- `company_name` VARCHAR(200) — single-name field for vendors/companies (migration-added).
  Display logic: `COALESCE(NULLIF(company_name,''), NULLIF(TRIM(first_name||' '||last_name),''))`.
  Backend stores vendor name in `company_name` + `last_name`; `first_name=''`.

**API endpoints:**
- `GET  /api/accounting/customers` — all customers, returns `display_name` (prefers company_name)
- `GET  /api/accounting/vendors` — customers with `vendor` role, returns `display_name`
- `POST /api/accounting/vendors` — create vendor; body: `{name}`. Creates customer row +
  assigns vendor role. Idempotent (adds role if customer already exists by name).

**Vendor typeahead in accounting modals:**
- All vendors shown at top of dropdown when field is focused (empty) — discoverable without typing
- Type to filter from all customers/vendors
- "＋ New Vendor" option always visible at bottom of dropdown; opens New Vendor modal
- After save, new vendor is immediately selected in the form
- Vendors appear with amber chip color (vs. green for non-vendor customers)
- Applies to: income/ledger modal (`#customer-id`), expense modal (`#exp-customer-id`)

## Customer Status and Role Editing (Info Tab)

Admins can edit a customer's **Member Status** and **Roles** from the Info tab
on any customer profile (all three rendering paths: inline expand, detail panel, mobile card).

**Member Status dropdown options:**
`1ST TIMER` / `GUEST` / `MEMBER` / `MEMBER+` / `FORMER`
- `member_plus` — new status (migration-adds to CHECK constraint); displayed as "MEMBER+"
- `expired_member` kept in DB for backward compat; displayed as "FORMER"

**Roles checkboxes:** `golfer`, `manager`, `admin`, `vendor`, `course_contact`, `sponsor`

> **Renamed:** the old `member` role string was renamed to `golfer` (lowercase, in
> `customer_roles.role_type`) because it collided conceptually with the `MEMBER`
> player_status display label, making code and conversation ambiguous. Migration
> `_migrate_rename_member_role_to_golfer` recreates the `customer_roles` table with the
> new CHECK and maps existing `member` rows to `golfer`. Idempotent (detects whether the
> migration already ran by inspecting the stored CREATE TABLE SQL). All `player_status`
> values (`MEMBER`, `MEMBER+`, `1ST TIMER`, `GUEST`, `FORMER`, `active_member`,
> `expired_member`, `MANAGER`) and `membership` item names are unchanged.
> Frontend constants updated: `ELEVATED` and `ALL_ROLES` arrays in customers.html, the
> four `hasRole(...)` guards in events.html's user_status validator, and the
> `valid_roles` set in `/api/replace-customer-roles`.

**Save flow:**
1. `PATCH /api/customers/<id>` — updates `current_player_status` via `update_customer_info()`
2. `POST /api/customers/sync-roles` — `{customer_id, roles[]}` replaces all roles atomically

**API:**
- `GET  /api/customer-roles` — returns roles per customer + `_by_name` map (name→customer_id);
  frontend uses `_by_name` as fallback when `items.customer_id` is null (pre-identity items).
  Per-customer dict also includes `current_player_status`, `first_timer_ever`, and `chapter`
  (read from the customers master record). The frontend overlays these onto each customer
  object, so the Customers page reads chapter authoritatively from the customers table
  rather than the items-derived `deriveChapter` fallback.
- `POST /api/customers/sync-roles` — `{customer_id, roles}` replaces full role set

## Status Derivation (`deriveStatus`)

`deriveStatus(items, roles, currentPlayerStatus)` (customers.html) returns one of
`MEMBER` / `MEMBER+` / `1st TIMER` / `FORMER` / `GUEST`. Precedence (most authoritative
first):

1. **Elevated role** — `owner` / `admin` / `manager` / `member` in `roles` → `MEMBER`.
2. **Membership purchase** — any item whose `item_name` contains `membership` (case-insensitive)
   → `MEMBER`. Hoisted above `current_player_status` so a customer who just bought a
   membership reads as `MEMBER` even before the stored status is updated.
3. **`current_player_status`**:
   - `active_member` → `MEMBER`
   - `member_plus` → `MEMBER+`
   - `first_timer` → `1st TIMER` **only if `items.length ≤ 1`**; otherwise demoted to `GUEST`
     (a customer flagged first-timer who has played more than once is no longer a first-timer).
   - `expired_member` / `inactive` → `FORMER`
   - `active_guest` → `GUEST`
4. **Items-based fallbacks** — membership in item name; `user_status === MEMBER`;
   `returning_or_new` containing "new"/"1st"/"first" (also capped at `items.length ≤ 1`);
   `NON-MEMBER` / `GUEST` user_status; default `GUEST`.

`c.status` is recomputed after the `/api/customer-roles` fetch resolves, so the badge
reflects the final (roles + player_status) view rather than the items-only first pass.

**Backend autocorrect** (`_migrate_autocorrect_player_status` in `email_parser/database.py`,
runs at `init_db`): mirrors the frontend rules into the database itself.
- Pass 1 — anyone with a `membership` item still flagged `first_timer` / `active_guest` /
  NULL → upgraded to `active_member`.
- Pass 2 — anyone still flagged `first_timer` with more than one item → demoted to
  `active_guest`.

`customer_roles` is intentionally not modified by the autocorrect; only the soft
`current_player_status` flag is flipped.

## Surname Uppercase for Elevated Roles (Events + Transactions only)

`displayName(name, status)` (in events.html and dashboard.js — **not** customers.html)
renders the surname in UPPERCASE when `status` is one of `MEMBER` / `MEMBER+` /
`MANAGER` / `OWNER` (case-insensitive). Render-only decoration; the underlying data
(`items.customer`, `customers.first_name` / `last_name`) stays in proper case. The
Customers page itself does **not** apply this decoration — surnames render in
proper case there to match the source-of-truth view.

For Not-Playing rows (which have no per-item `user_status`), `get_rsvps_for_event`
and `get_all_rsvps_bulk` surface `customer_status` (derived from
`customers.current_player_status` + `customer_roles`) on each rsvp dict so the
renderer can apply the uppercase decoration consistently.

## Chapter Selection (Info Tab)

The Chapter field on the Info tab and the Add-Customer modal is a constrained
`<select>` populated from `/api/chapters` (the canonical chapters dim table — five
entries: San Antonio, Austin, DFW, Houston, Hill Country). Legacy values that
don't match a canonical chapter are preserved as a "(legacy)" option until an
admin picks a canonical one.

**Save flow:** the Save handler reads the selected chapter from `.cust-edit-input`
(class works for both `<input>` and `<select>`). `update_customer_info` writes
the chapter string to:
- `items.chapter` for every items row matching the customer (denormalized cache).
- `customers.chapter` (master record).

The customers table is the authoritative source. `/api/customer-roles` returns
`chapter` per customer, and the Customers page overlays it onto each customer
object after the fetch resolves.

**Note:** `customers.chapter` is still a `VARCHAR(50)` text column. `items.chapter_id`
and `events.chapter_id` are FKs to `chapters.chapter_id`, but `customers` does not
yet have a `chapter_id` column. Adding the FK to `customers` is deferred — see
`docs/claude/schema.md → Deferred / Known Concessions`.

## Customers Page List — Activity Year Filter

The Customers list has an **Activity** dropdown (`This Year` default, `Last Year`,
`All Years`) next to the Active/Archived filter. With `This Year` selected, the
list filters to customers who have at least one **real purchase** in the target
year — defined as an item whose `order_date` starts with the year, whose
`transaction_status` is not `rsvp_only` / `gg_rsvp`, and whose `merchant` is
not in `PLACEHOLDER_MERCHANTS`:

```
Roster Import / Customer Entry / RSVP Import / RSVP Email Link
```

Roster Import items also do not appear in the customer-detail Transactions tab.

## Customers Page List — Credit-Balance Filter

A second dropdown (**All Credits / With Credit / No Credit**) sits next to the existing
filters so admins can quickly isolate players carrying a credit balance — the same
balance surfaced by the orange "$X.XX CREDIT" badge next to the customer name. Cents are
shown via `toLocaleString({min: 2, max: 2})` so a $0.19 overpayment credit reads as
"$0.19 Credit" instead of "$0 Credit". `totalSpent` formatting stays whole-dollar.

## Customers Page — Row Tinting by Status

Each customer row (desktop table + mobile card) gets a status-based class:
- `cust-row-member` — mint green (`#d1fae5`)
- `cust-row-member-plus` — teal (`#99f6e4`)
- `cust-row-first-timer` — amber (`#fde68a`)
- `cust-row-former` — slate gray (`#e2e8f0`, muted text)
- `cust-row-guest` — white (default)

`statusRowClass(status)` maps `c.status` to the class. Hover deepens the tint
one shade. Mobile cards add a 4px left border in a deeper shade for accent.

## Members Stat Card

The "Members" stat card always reflects all-time member counts (does not respect
the Activity-Year filter). Counts `c.status === "MEMBER" || c.status === "MEMBER+"`.
A per-chapter breakdown renders beneath the count, sorted by chapter size desc
then alphabetically.

# Membership renewal system

A separate `customer_memberships` table tracks one row per term (year). The
latest row per customer is the "current" term; older rows are history.
Implementation lives in `email_parser/memberships.py` (kept out of the giant
`database.py` to keep it self-contained).

## Term length policy

- Terms started **2025-01-01 or later** run **365 days from the date of purchase**
  (TGF's current policy).
- Older terms run to **December 31 of the start year** (legacy calendar-year
  policy). `compute_expires_at(started_at)` applies the cutoff (`POLICY_365_FROM_YEAR = 2025`).
- The Add-Term modal pre-fills `expires_at` based on the chosen `started_at` but
  admins can override it manually for edge cases.

## Backfill

`backfill_memberships_from_items(conn)` runs at boot from `init_db`. Idempotent —
inserts one term row per parsed `items` row where
`LOWER(item_name) LIKE '%membership%'`, deduped by `UNIQUE(customer_id, started_at)`.
Items without a `customer_id` are skipped (they'll be picked up on a future boot
once identity-resolution catches them).

## Renewal detection

`save_items()` calls `record_renewal_for_item(conn, item_id, send_email=None)`
for every newly-inserted membership row. That opens a fresh term row for the
customer (idempotent) and tags it `source='renewal'`. The actual
"thanks for renewing" email is fired by the daily scheduler job, not from
inside the parser path — this keeps `save_items` synchronous and means the
confirmation reaches the member within ~24 hours of the order parsing.

## Notice schedule

`daily_membership_job(send_email)` runs at **09:00 US/Central** (configurable
via `DAILY_REPORT_TZ`). Hits four windows per term, idempotently:

| Window | Days from `expires_at` | Column stamped |
|---|---|---|
| 30 days before | -30 | `notice_30d_sent_at` |
| 7 days before | -7 | `notice_7d_sent_at` |
| Day of expiry | 0 | `notice_dayof_sent_at` |
| Lapsed (final notice) | +14 | `notice_lapsed_sent_at` |

For each row with the matching `expires_at` and that column NULL, the job:

1. Checks for a **later term** for the same customer (renewal already came in).
   If one exists, the column is stamped without sending — reminders auto-shut-off.
   `counts["skipped_renewed"]` increments.
2. Looks up the canonical email via `customer_emails.is_primary`. Skips silently
   if no email is on file.
3. Renders the per-window email via `render_notice_email(window, term, customer)`
   and fires it through Microsoft Graph (`_membership_send_email` wrapper in
   `app.py`).
4. Stamps the column with `datetime('now')` only on a successful send so a
   transient Graph failure retries on the next run.

The same job also:
- Sends pending **renewal confirmations** — terms whose prior term had any
  notice column set and whose `confirmation_sent_at` is NULL.
- Sends the **no-response admin digest** to `admin@thegolffellowship.com` when
  `notice_lapsed_sent_at` was 7+ days ago and `roster_choice IS NULL`. Stamps
  `roster_admin_notified_at` so each term's digest is one-shot.

Manual trigger: `POST /api/admin/run-membership-reminders` (admin) returns the
counts dict for inspection.

## Email templates — v1.0 standards (May 2026)

All four notice templates plus the renewal confirmation sit in
`render_notice_email(window, term, customer, with_roster_buttons=None)` and
`render_confirmation_email(term, customer, order_id)`.

**Subjects (locked to spec):**

- **30d** — "Your TGF membership expires in 30 days"
- **7d** — "Your TGF membership expires in 7 days"
- **dayof** — "Your TGF membership expires today"
- **lapsed** — "One last note from TGF"
- **confirmation** — "Thanks for renewing your TGF membership"

**Body openings (each has a unique warmth line):**

- **30d** — "The Golf Fellowship is built on people like you — and we'd love to keep you in it."
- **7d** — "The Golf Fellowship wouldn't be what it is without members like you — just didn't want this to slip by unnoticed."
- **dayof** — "Today's the last day of your Golf Fellowship membership — and we'd really love to keep you in the crew."
- **lapsed** — "The Fellowship is better because you were part of it — hoping we can keep it that way."

**Closings (two locked variants depending on `with_roster_buttons`):**

- With buttons: `_roster_buttons_block(term)` ends with "Either way, no hard feelings — just hit the button that works for you and we'll handle the rest. You're always welcome back whenever the time is right."
- Without buttons: `_THANKS_LINE` = "Thanks for being part of The Golf Fellowship."

Sign-off is consistent across both: `— The Golf Fellowship`.

**Golf Genius opt-in/out section (locked, identical everywhere it appears):**

> Still want the weekly invites? We send event invitations through Golf Genius every week. If that's still working for you, great. If not, just let us know and we'll take care of it:
>
> [✓ Keep me on the invite list] [No need to keep me posted]

The Remove button is neutral grey (`#6b7280`), not red — the opt-out reads
as a courtesy, not a destructive action.

**`with_roster_buttons` defaulting:**

- `None` (the default when no kwarg is passed) applies a per-window default:
  lapsed → `True`, all others → `False`. This matches the daily-scheduler
  behavior (lapsed always carries the section).
- Explicit `True` / `False` overrides — used by the Send Notice Now modal's
  toggle. The lapsed window now respects the toggle (the spec includes both
  variants); the modal defaults the toggle to checked when the lapsed window
  is selected and remembers the admin's override during the session.

`MEMBERSHIP_PRICE = 75` is a constant. The renewal URL defaults to
`https://thegolffellowship.com/shop/ols/products/tgf-membership` but is
read from `MEMBERSHIP_RENEWAL_URL` env var at render time (`_renewal_url()`
helper) so the storefront link can be updated without a code deploy.

The Send Notice Now modal exposes the rendered subject as an **editable**
input with a Reset button. The send endpoint accepts an optional `subject`
field that overrides the rendered subject — useful when an off-cycle send
needs different wording (e.g. firing T-30 on a term that's already lapsed).

## Roster opt-in / opt-out (lapsed-notice buttons)

The lapsed-notice email contains two HMAC-signed one-click links:

- **Keep on rosters** → `/m/roster/<token>` with `action=keep`
- **Remove from rosters** → `/m/roster/<token>` with `action=remove`

Token format: `base64url(json{c, t, a, e}).hmac_sha256_first32` where
`c=customer_id`, `t=term_id`, `a=keep|remove`, `e=unix_expiry`.
`SECRET_KEY` is the HMAC secret. TTL is **30 days** (`ROSTER_TOKEN_TTL_DAYS`).

`apply_roster_choice(token, send_email)`:
- Verifies the token (signature + expiry).
- Idempotent — a second click for the same action just re-renders the page
  without re-notifying admin.
- Updates `roster_choice`, `roster_choice_at`.
- Notifies `admin@thegolffellowship.com` with the member's name + email +
  link back to the customer page (one-shot per click).

The route renders a small standalone HTML page (`_public_page`) with a green
or red confirmation banner — no auth required, no app shell.

## No-response digest

If neither button is clicked within `NO_RESPONSE_DIGEST_DAYS = 7` days of the
lapsed notice (and no later term has been recorded), the daily job sends a
single digest email to `admin@thegolffellowship.com` listing every such member.
`roster_admin_notified_at` is stamped per-row so the digest is one-shot per
term. A late renewal still cancels follow-up actions because the daily job
re-checks `EXISTS (later term)` before including a row.

## Customer Info tab UI

A new **Membership Terms** card on the Info tab shows every term newest-first:

- `started_at → expires_at` with a status badge (Active / Active · N days left
  in the 30-day warning window / Lapsed N days ago).
- Roster choice if recorded (✅ stays / ❌ removed / "awaiting reply" if the
  lapsed notice was sent).
- Source badge (parsed / renewal / manual / backfill).
- Notices summary (30d · 7d · 0d · lapsed · confirmed) — empty if none sent.
- Free-form notes if present.
- **Admins** see `+ Add term`, Edit, and ✕ Delete buttons; everyone else
  sees read-only.

Wired from both render paths (inline expand + detail panel) via
`loadCustomerMemberships(container)` + `wireMembershipUI(container)` (the
latter is idempotent via a `_membershipWired` flag). The Add modal pre-fills
`expires_at` from the chosen `started_at` based on the policy.

## Customers list — Renewal column

The Customers list page renders a **Renewal** column between HCP and Last
Activity, showing each customer's current term's `expires_at` as a colored
badge:

- Green (`#dcfce7` bg) — active, more than 30 days left
- Amber (`#fef3c7` bg) — active, 30 days or less remaining (with `Nd` left)
- Red (`#fee2e2` bg) — lapsed (with `-Nd` since expiry)
- Em-dash — no membership term on file

`init()` fetches `GET /api/memberships/current` (one row per customer,
latest term) and overlays `c.membershipTerm` onto each customer object.
The column is sortable: `renewalSortKey(c)` puts customers without terms
last via a sentinel character.

## Send notice now (admin) — preview modal

Each term row on the Membership Terms card shows a **Send notice** button
for admins. Clicking opens a modal with:
- Window selector: T-30 / T-7 / T-0 / T+14 lapsed / Confirmation
- Live preview iframe of the rendered email body (sandboxed)
- Recipient address and subject line
- Send button (disabled if no primary email on file)

`POST /api/memberships/<term_id>/send-notice` with `{window}` fires the
email through Microsoft Graph and stamps the matching `*_sent_at` column
so the daily scheduler doesn't re-fire the same window.

`GET /api/memberships/<term_id>/preview-notice?window=<w>` returns
`{to, subject, html, term, customer, can_send, reason}` — the modal calls
this on every dropdown change so admins see exactly what will go out.

## Admin copy on every membership email

`_membership_send_email(to, subject, html)` (the wrapper in `app.py` that
all membership notices fire through) automatically copies admin on every
send via two env-var-driven rules:

| Direction | Env var | Default | Header |
|---|---|---|---|
| Admin-facing (TO is admin@thegolffellowship.com — roster opt-in/out, no-response digest) | `MEMBERSHIP_ADMIN_CC` | `admin@thegolffellowship.com` | **CC** |
| Member-facing (TO is anything else — daily reminders, Send Notice Now) | `MEMBERSHIP_MEMBER_BCC` | `admin@thegolffellowship.com` | **BCC** |

Both env vars accept comma-separated lists. Set either to `""` to disable
that copy entirely. Both lists are de-duplicated against the TO line, so an
address already on TO is never re-added — meaning if TO=admin@ and CC
default is also admin@, the CC is dropped and the admin gets one copy
(not two).

BCC is used for member-facing notices specifically so the member's email
client doesn't display admin@ on their headers — the admin gets a quiet
paper trail without changing how the email reads to the recipient.

`send_mail_graph(..., cc_address=None, bcc_address=None)` (in
`email_parser/fetcher.py`) adds real `ccRecipients` / `bccRecipients` to
the Graph payload — not extra TOs.

# Customers Page — Key Behaviors

## Name display format
- All customer/player names display as **"Last, First"** across all pages
- `displayName()` helper converts "First Last" → "Last, First" with suffix handling
- Suffixes (Jr, Sr, II, III, IV, V) are preserved after the first name
- Example: "Victor Arias III" → "Arias, Victor III"
- The underlying data (`items.customer`) remains "First Last" — only display changes

## Name sorting
- `lastNameSortKey()` sorts by last name, stripping suffixes before comparison
- Used on all pages: Transactions, Events, Customers, Handicaps, RSVP Log
- "Victor Arias III" and "Victor Arias JR" sort together under "Arias"

## Merge customer modal
- Uses typeahead autocomplete input (not a dropdown)
- Type to search, click to select from suggestions
- Candidates sorted by last name with purchase counts

## "Purchased by" badge
- When `item.notes` contains "Purchased by X", a blue badge shows on the transaction row
- Indicates someone else paid for this player's registration

## Click-to-navigate
- Transaction rows in customer detail have `data-txn-id` and are clickable
- Clicking navigates to `/?txn=<id>` which deep-links to the Transactions tab

# Customers Page — Tab System

## Three rendering paths (IMPORTANT)
The Customers page has 3 separate rendering paths that must be kept in sync:
1. **Inline expanded card** (desktop list view, click to expand) — ~line 1150 in customers.html
2. **Detail panel** (`selectCustomer()`, used in Cards view) — ~line 1674
3. **Mobile card view** (responsive layout) — ~line 663

## Five tabs on all views
Each rendering path has 5 tabs: **Transactions**, **Scores**, **Winnings**, **Points**, **Info**

- **Transactions** — customer's purchase history with click-to-navigate to `/` page
- **Scores** — handicap data loaded via `/api/handicaps/players`, shows index + round history
- **Winnings** — TGF payout history loaded via `/api/customers/winnings`
- **Points** — placeholder for future points system
- **Info** — customer metadata (email, phone, chapter, GHIN, status)

## Customer winnings API
- `GET /api/customers/winnings?customer_name=<name>` — returns payout history
- `get_customer_winnings()` uses multi-step name matching:
  exact → case-insensitive → alias → name reversal
- Returns `{golfer_name, total_winnings, payouts: [{event_name, date, category, amount}]}`

## Customer detail Transactions tab — display columns

The Customer detail Transactions tab renders the same `displaySideGames` / `displayItemNotes`
helpers as the Transactions page:

- `displaySideGames(item)` only renders `NET / GROSS / BOTH / NONE`. Anything else
  collapses to an em-dash so free-form text doesn't pollute the Side Games column.
- `displayItemNotes(item)` joins `item.notes` (with internal markers like
  `[venmo-bd-exp:N]` and `[xfer-consumed:N]` stripped) with any non-canonical
  `side_games` text, separated by ` — `. Notes truncate to `14rem` with overflow
  ellipsis + `title=` tooltip for the full text.

Other columns in this tab:
- **Account** — derived from merchant: `The Golf Fellowship` → GoDaddy,
  `Manual Entry (Venmo)` → Venmo, `Manual Entry` → Manual,
  `Paid Separately ...` → Credit Transfer, RSVP/Roster/Customer Entry variants → labeled.
- **Total / Fees** — `total_amount` with `transaction_fees` in muted grey.
- **Multi-item order hint** — when an `order_id` is shared across rows, the Item cell
  shows a small italic `<N>-item order <id>` subtitle. Single-item orders show
  `order_id` in light grey.
- **From-transfer indicator** — same circular navy `T` badge used on Events
  (replaces the older "From Transfer" pill).
- **Coupon C-badge** — purple `.coupon-badge` on items with `coupon_code` or
  `coupon_amount` set.

**Reverse hidden on credit-pool rows.** New JS helper `isCreditPoolRow(row)` detects
credit-pool rows by `email_uid` prefix (`credit-excess-` / `overpayment-credit-`) and
hides Reverse on them across every render site (desktop INACTIVE chip, mobile chip,
desktop Players-tab actions dropdown, mobile player-row, customer detail Transactions
tab). Reverse on these rows previously flipped `transaction_status` from `credited` to
`active` and cleared `credit_note`, leaving a phantom active registration on the event.
To unwind a credit-pool row, reverse the parent credit-transfer instead —
`reverse_credit_application` already deletes excess + overpayment children.

## Storage migration: non-canonical side_games → notes

Pairs with the display helper above. `_migrate_move_noncanonical_side_games_to_notes`
runs at startup once: any `items` row where `side_games` is non-empty and not in
`{NET, GROSS, BOTH, NONE}` has the text appended to `notes` (with `' — '` separator if
notes already had content, skipping if the exact text is already in notes), then
`side_games` is cleared. Idempotent.

## Canonical customer data API
- `GET /api/customers` — returns all customers from canonical tables
- `get_all_customers()` — `SELECT FROM customers LEFT JOIN customer_emails WHERE is_primary=1`
  returns `customer_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `customer_name` (display), `phone`,
  `primary_email`, `email_label`, and other customer fields
- Customers page `init()` overlays this data after building the items-based map, ensuring
  email and phone always reflect canonical values rather than stale transaction copies
